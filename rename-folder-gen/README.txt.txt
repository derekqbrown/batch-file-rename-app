This is a program that allows users to quickly generate names for all files in a folder

The "Randomize" option uses the adj, items and noun .txt files which contain lists of words to generate a random name for the file.

The "Folder" option uses the folder name containing the files to generate names (appending a number to the end of each filename)

The "Batch" options will check all folders within the selected folder and apply the above to each subfolder.
